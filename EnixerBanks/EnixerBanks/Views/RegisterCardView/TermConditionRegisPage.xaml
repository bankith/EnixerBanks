                <Label Text="1. Orders

    All orders placed by Buyer are subject to written acceptance by Seller. Orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled without Seller's prior written consent. Buyer is responsible for the accuracy of its order and any Buyer's specification and for supplying any relevant information within sufficient time to enable Seller to perform the contract for delivery of Products/Services. Seller may in its sole discretion allocate Product to its Customers. Seller may designate certain Products as NCNR (non-cancelable, non-returnable) or C/S (Customer specific) and the sale of such Products shall be subject to the special terms and conditions contained in Seller's NCNR/Special Product Agreement, which shall prevail and supersede any inconsistent terms and conditions contained herein or elsewhere. Seller reserves the right to make changes to the specifications of any Product and/or Services supplied which are required to conform with any applicable safety, statutory or EC requirements or, where Product is to be supplied to Product's specification, which do not materially affect the quality or performance, or resulting from any change in manufacturer's product specification.

    2. Prices

    (a) The prices of the Products are those specified in Seller's invoice for the relevant Product. Pricing for undelivered Product may be increased in the event of any increase in Seller's costs, change in market conditions or any other causes beyond Seller's reasonable control. Quotations, unless otherwise stated, are valid on day of issue only; thereafter Seller may change them without notice.

    (b) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller, all prices quoted are exclusive of transportation and insurance costs, duties, and all taxes including, but not limited to Value Added Tax. Buyer agrees to pay these taxes unless the Seller agrees in writing that the sale is exempted. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless for any liability for tax in connection with the sale, as well as the collection or withholding thereof, including penalties and interest thereon. When applicable, transportation and taxes shall appear as separate items on Seller's invoice.

    3. Payment

    (a) Seller's standard terms of payment are net thirty (30) days from the date of invoice unless otherwise specified in writing by Seller. Seller may invoice each shipment separately and each shipment shall be considered a separate and individual contract. Buyer agrees to pay Seller's invoice in full without any deductions or set-off.

    (b) Time for payment of invoices is of the essence. All late payments shall be charged interest computed on a daily basis from the due date until paid in full. Seller is entitled to receive interest at the rate of one percent (1 %) per month or the maximum rate permitted by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 as Seller may deem appropriate plus reimbursement for costs of debt collection (including reasonable legal fees of Seller and court costs) to collect full payment for Products/Services supplied.

    (c) Transportation charges from Seller's facility to Buyer's facility shall be paid by Buyer to Seller, in addition to the purchase price of the Product, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller. Seller will select the carrier in the absence of specific instructions by Buyer.

    (d) Seller reserves the right to establish or change credit or payment terms when, in Seller's sole opinion, Buyer's financial condition or payment record warrants it. If payment is late Seller shall not be obliged to continue performance and or to carry out any further work under the contract for delivery of the Products/Services or on any other contract with the Buyer; and if any of the Buyer's obligations to the Seller are not fulfilled or Buyer fails to pay for Products/Services supplied, Seller may, without prejudice to other remedies available, cancel, suspend or terminate the contract for the relevant Products/Services.

    4. Delivery

    Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Seller all deliveries will be made EXW (Ex Works) Seller's facility (as defined in Incoterms 2000). Delivery will be deemed complete and risk of loss or damage to the Products will pass to Buyer upon delivery to the carrier. Buyer acknowledges that delivery dates provided by Seller are estimates only and Seller shall not be liable for delays in delivery or for failure to perform due to events beyond the reasonable control of Seller nor shall the carrier be deemed an agent of Seller. In the event of delay caused by such event, the date of delivery shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost as a consequence of the delay in delivery without subjecting Seller to any liability or penalty. Time for delivery shall not be of the essence. If the Products perish while in the custody of the carrier, the Seller shall be deemed to have performed its obligations in full. Where the Products and/or Services are to be delivered in instalments each delivery shall constitute a separate contract and failure by Seller to deliver any one or more instalments under these Conditions or any claim by Buyer in respect of any instalment shall not entitle Buyer to refuse future deliveries. Title in the Product shall not pass to Buyer until such time as full payment for the Product has been received by Seller and until such time, Buyer shall hold the Product as Seller's fiduciary agent or trustee and bailee, and shall keep the Product separate to Buyer's goods and to those of third parties and properly stored, protected, insured and identified as Seller's property, but shall be entitled to resell or use the Product in the ordinary course of Seller's business. Until title in the Product passes to Buyer, Seller can require Buyer to return the Products and, if Buyer fails to do so, immediately on request, Seller may enter Buyer's premises to repossess them. Buyer shall indemnify Seller against liability for damage caused in repossessing Products. Buyer shall not pledge or in any way charge by way of security for any indebtedness any of the Products which remain Seller's property, but if Buyer does so, all moneys owing by Buyer to Seller shall forthwith become due and payable. Buyer agrees, from time to time, to take any act and execute and deliver any document (including, without limitation, financing statements) reasonably requested by Seller to transfer, create, perfect, preserve, protect and enforce the provisions of this Clause 4.

    5. Acceptance/Returns

    Shipments will be deemed to have been accepted by Buyer upon receipt of Products at the agreed point of delivery. Buyer shall perform whatever inspection or tests Buyer deems necessary as promptly as possible but in any event within seven days of delivery. Any discrepancy in shipment quantity must be reported to the Seller within seven (7) days of receipt of the Products. In the event of an over-shipment, Buyer shall have the option to return the Products to Seller at Seller's expense or alternatively, Buyer may elect to retain the excess Product (subject to adjustment of the invoice price to account for excess items.) Any Product returns shall be subject to compliance with Seller's Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) policies and procedures as well as applicable restocking charges. Buyer may obtain details of these from Seller on request. Returned Products must be in the original packaging and conform with minimum package quantity (MPQ) requirements of the Seller.

    6. Limited Warranty and Limitation of Liability

    (a) Seller will transfer to Buyer any transferable warranties or indemnities that the manufacturer of the Product or the third party vendor/service provider provides to Seller. SELLER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TOWARDS BUYER BEYOND THE EXPRESS TERMS OF SUCH MANUFACTURER PRODUCT WARRANTIES. SELLER ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE QUALITY OF THE WORK PERFORMED OR SERVICES RENDERED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS/SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT IS BUYER'S OBLIGATION TO REQUEST COPIES OF ANY APPLICABLE MANUFACTURER WARRANTIES AND BUYER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH WARRANTIES UPON ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES.

    (b) Seller's exclusive obligations with respect to a non-conforming Product or Service shall be, at Seller's option, to repair or replace the Product, if it is determined to be defective, or to re-perform the Service, or to refund to Buyer the purchase price paid for the Product or Service. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the liability of Seller under this Section 6(b) for all claims shall not exceed the sum of Buyer's payments for the Products or Services which are the subject of the dispute and the foregoing is Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy for all claims under this Section 6(b). THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE THE SOLE WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GIVEN BY SELLER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS AND WARRANTIES AGAINST LATENT DEFECTS.

    (c) Replacement Products shall be warranted as set forth in Section 6(a) above. Any Products repaired or serviced by Seller shall be warranted as provided in this Section 6(b) for the remainder of the manufacturer's warranty period.

    (d) No warranty shall apply to any Product that has been subject to misuse, improper testing, assembly, mishandling, or which has been operated contrary to current instructions relating to installation, maintenance or operation, or contrary to industry standards relating to acceptable input power.

    (e) Seller disclaims, and shall have no liability for any trademark, trade dress, trade secret, copyright, design or patent infringement, or any other intellectual property right, which may occur, as a result of the sale of Products to Buyer. The only remedy or recourse for trademark, trade dress, trade secret, copyright, design or patent infringement, or any other intellectual property right, shall be against the manufacturer of the Products which is explicitly subject to the limited warranty of the manufacturer of the Product. There shall be no remedy or recourse against Seller or the manufacturer to the extent the infringement arises from or is otherwise based upon (i) the manufacturer's compliance with the particular requirements of Buyer that differ from the manufacturer's standard specifications for the Product; (ii) modifications or alterations of the product other than by the manufacturer; or (iii) a combination of the Product with other items not furnished or manufactured by the manufacturer.

    (f) BUYER SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT BE ENTITLED TO, AND SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION COSTS, REMOVAL AND/OR REINSTALLATION COSTS, REPROCUREMENT COSTS, LOSS OF PROFIT OR REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, PROMOTIONAL OR MANUFACTURING EXPENSES, OVERHEAD, INJURY TO REPUTATION OR LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, EVEN IF SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BUYER'S RECOVERY FROM SELLER FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED BUYER'S PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE. SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AND BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD SELLER HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS BASED ON SELLER'S COMPLIANCE WITH BUYER'S DESIGNS, SPECIFICATIONS OR INSTRUCTIONS, OR MODIFICATION OF ANY PRODUCTS BY PARTIES OTHER THAN SELLER, OR USE IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS. IF, FOR ANY REASON, THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ARE FOUND BY AN ARBITRATION PANEL OR COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE INVALID OR INAPPLICABLE UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE OR PROVINCIAL LAW, BUYER AGREES THAT SELLER'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES PROVIDED BY ANY SUCH APPLICABLE LAW.

    (g) Buyer acknowledges that this Agreement was entered into at arms length and that it was not fraudulently induced to enter into this Agreement, in whole or any part, and Buyer explicitly disclaims and waives any claim with respect thereto."
